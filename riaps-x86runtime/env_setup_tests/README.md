This folder contains a generic application to test that the development environment is setup and able to talk with the configured BBBs.  If you do not see the expected results, please send an email to riap@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu describing the situation and any include any output log information.

## First Test VM with application on local node (VM)
1. Open 3 terminal windows

   a. ``` rpyc_registry ```
   
   b. ``` riaps_ctrl ```
   
   c. ``` riaps_deplo ```

2. With the 'riaps_ctrl' command, the RIAPS control GUI will come up.  You should see the IP address of your VM added as a node.

3. In the control GUI, select the **WeatherMonitor** located under **~/env_setup_tests** folder using the **wmonitor_vm_only.depl** file.  Then **Load** (button on the right) and click on the loaded WeatherMonitor application to **Launch** it.
    
    MM TODO:  add this copy to the bootstrap code
    
4. When you launch this application, you should see the following output on the RIAPS control GUI and from the different windows.

## Second Test a Single BBB Talks with the VM
1.  SSH into the BBB, where xxxx refers to the hostname that you see when you log into the BBB.  If you do not know the hostname yet, you can use the IP address instead (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx).

    ```       
    ssh riaps@bbb-xxxx.local 
    
    ```
    
2.  On the VM, open 2 terminal windows
   
   a. ``` rpyc_registry ```
   
   b. ``` riaps_ctrl ```
   
3.  On the BBB, run ``` riaps_deplo ```

4.  With the 'riaps_ctrl' command, the RIAPS control GUI will come up.  You should see the IP address of your BBB added as a node.
        
5.  Edit the **~/env_setup_tests/WeatherMonitor/wmonitor_1_bbb.depl** file to point to your BBB using either the hostname or the IP address.

6.  In the control GUI, select the **WeatherMonitor** located under **~/env_setup_tests** folder using the **wmonitor_1_bbb.depl** file.

7.  When you launch this application, you should see the following output on the RIAPS control GUI and on the BBB.

## Third Test that Multiple BBBs can Talk with the VM
1.  SSH into the BBBs, where xxxx refers to the hostname that you see when you log into the BBBs.
  
    ``` ssh riaps@bbb-xxxx.local ```
    
2.  On the VM, open 2 terminal windows
   
   a. ``` rpyc_registry ```
   
   b. ``` riaps_ctrl ```
   
3.  On the BBB, run ``` riaps_deplo ```

4.  With the 'riaps_ctrl' command, the RIAPS control GUI will come up.  You should see the IP address of your BBB added as a node.
        
5.  The **~/env_setup_tests/WeatherMonitor/wmonitor_manny_bbb.depl** file is setup to have a single BBB be the WeatherReceiver and then all BBBs will report a temperature number (WeatherIndicator).  Edit this file to point the WeatherReceiver to one of your BBBs using either the hostname or the IP address.

6.  In the control GUI, select the **WeatherMonitor** located under **~/env_setup_tests** folder using the **wmonitor_many_bbb.depl** file.

7.  When you launch this application, you should see the following output on the RIAPS control GUI and on the BBBs.
