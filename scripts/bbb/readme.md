# BBB Folder Contents

This folder contains beaglebone specific installation scripts.  

  * fabfile_bbb.py is used for installations and updates from a Linux VM to the BBBs
  * riaps_bbb_base_setup.sh runs on the BBB to install RIAPS specific configurations and dependencies
  * subfolders contain information to be transferred and installed on the BBB during the RIAPS installation

# How to Create a BBB from Ubuntu Pre-configured Image

This work should be done on a Linux machine or VM.  We are starting with a pre-configured BBB Ubuntu image and modifying it to add the RT Patch kernel and any other customizations needed for RIAPS.

1. Download a complete pre-configured image (Ubuntu 16.04) onto the BBB SD Card - http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu (Instructions - start with Method 1)

  `wget https://rcn-ee.com/rootfs/2017-04-07/elinux/ubuntu-16.04.2-console-armhf-2017-04-07.tar.xz`

2. Unpack image

  ```
  tar xf ubuntu-16.04.2-console-armhf-2017-04-07.tar.xz`
  cd ubuntu-16.04.2-console-armhf-2017-04-07
  ```

  Username:  ubuntu
  Password:   temppwd
  Kernel:  v4.4.59-ti-r96 kernel (updated on 2017-04-07)

3. Locate the SD Card on the Linux machine

  `sudo ./setup_sdcard.sh --probe-mmc`
  
4. Install image on SD card

  `sudo ./setup_sdcard.sh --mmc /dev/sdX --dtb beaglebone`

5. Download the needed files for installation
    
  `git clone riaps-integration`
    
6. Pull the latest RIAPS software to the VM

	`./download_packages.sh arch="armhf" version_conf="../version.sh" setup_conf="setup.conf"`
	
	where version_conf and setup_conf point to the locations of the files.  
	* 'version.sh' is configured in the repository with the latest releases.
	* 'setup.conf' is customized to the person downloading (containing reference to locations of SSH and GITHUB OAUTH keys).  Only an example of this file will located in the riaps-integration repository.  User will need to edit this file for their setup. 
	    
7. Using 'fabfile_bbb.py' either do a full installation on the BBB (the first time) or an update when desired
	
	`fab -f fabfile_bbb.py bbb_full_install`   
	   
	            or
	            
	`fab -f fabfile_bbb.py bbb_install_update`  	
	
	Note:  Fabric must be installed on the VM (sudo pip install fabric).  This is a python2 script.  
	This fabric file should be configured to work with your particular VM.  This example is connection to a specific VM addressable only by the testing VM.
	
	  `env.hosts = ['192.168.1.102']`


Work from this point is on the intended BBB

8. SSH into the BBB and go to the install directory

	`cd //install_files/scripts/bbb/`
	
9.  Run the installation script.  This will take about 65 mins to complete.  When done, the installation directory will be removed and the install-bbb.log will remain.

	`sudo ./riaps_bbb_base_setup.sh  | tee ~\install-bbb.log`
	
10.  Reboot the BBB and log back in as 'riaps' user to begin using the BBB.
